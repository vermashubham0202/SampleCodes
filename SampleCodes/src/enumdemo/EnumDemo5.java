 * 157-Program to create variable and methods inside enum.
 * 
 * -> The way we create variable and methods in class, the same way we can create
 * 		variables and methods in enum. (That is also a difference between enum of java and enum
 * 		of C & C++.)
 * 
 * -> We can also create the Constructor inside the enum, because it is finally going to
 * 		be converted into a class by the compiler.
 * -> Number of constants define the number of constructor's call.
 * 
 * -> Every enum in Java extends a class called as Enum. We will get more methods because of that.
