127-Program to demonstrate collection and generics in Java.
collection - concept
Collection - interface
Collections - class
->	We have lots of interfaces and lots of classes in one big package which is Collection API.
->	Collection doesn't work with index numbers.
->	We got Collection from Java 1.2 and generics from Java 1.5
-> 	From Java 1.7 we don't require to write <Data Type> on Right Hand Side.

		/* 
		 * ->	If we want to add another number in between 4 and 7, then it can not be done
		 * 		because Collection don't work with index numbers, so in order to work with index
		 * 		number we have to use 'List'.
		 * 
		 * 		'List' implements Collection with extra features and one of them is, it works with index numbers.
		 * 		When we traverse or trying to print values of 'List' the we get all the values in sequence.
		 * 		(order of getting elements is fixed)
		 * 
		 * ->	To avoid duplicate values we can use 'Set' instead of 'List'.
		 * 		Again Set is an interface.
		 * 
		 * 		Set<Integer> numbers = new HashSet<>();
		 * 		'HashSet' is a class which implements 'Set'.
		 * 		Every element in 'Set' will be unique.
		 * 	
		 * 		When we traverse or trying to print values of 'Set' the we get all the values randomly.
		 * 		(order of getting elements is random)
		 * 
		 * -> 	Instead of using 'HashSet' we can use the 'TreeSet'.
		 * 		Set<Integer> numbers = new TreeSet<>();
		 * 		
		 * 		The advantage with 'TreeSet' is, it will give you elements in sorted format.
		 * 
		 * -> 	In 'List' we can have duplicate elements with unique index numbers.
		 * 		We have an interface called as 'Map'. 
		 * 		'Map' has a <key,value> pair (relationship). Which means for every 'value' we have a 'key'.
		 * 	
		 * 		Map<Integer, String> m = new HashMap<>();
		 * 		Here Integer value is key and String values are value.
		 * 		'HashMap' is a class which implements interface 'Map'.
		 * 
		 * 		'HashTable' is also a class which implements 'Map'.
		 * 		One is synchronized and one is not.
		 * 		You can go for thread safe implementation or non-thread-safe implementation depend upon your requirement.
