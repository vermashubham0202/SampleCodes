110-Program to demonstrate object cloning in Java.
-> Object cloning is combination of Shallow Copy and Deep Copy.
-> By default in Java object instances are not allowed to be clone for security reasons.
-> To give permission to clone an object of a class you should 'implements Cloneable' interface, it
	is a marker interface (it has no method).
-> Marker interface are usually used for permissions.
