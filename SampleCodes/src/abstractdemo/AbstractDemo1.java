/*
76-Program to demonstrate abstraction in Java.
-> Abstraction means instead of focusing on main implementation we are focusing on abstract part of it.
-> If you have abstract methods in your class then your class also have to be abstract.
	But it doesn't mean that if you want to create abstract class then you have to
	create abstract methods.
-> In abstract class we can have abstract methods or normal methods or both.
-> We can not create object of abstract class.

-> Abstract methods are those methods which are declared, not defined.
	Eg.
	public abstract void login();
