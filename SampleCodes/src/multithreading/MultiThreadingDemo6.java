125-Program to demonstrate Multi-threading Synchronized keyword in Java.
-> In below example when two threads are doing increment at the same time, the count++ statement
	creates problem because there is no mutual exclusion.
-> To solve this issue we have to make our method increment 'synchronized', so that only one
	thread is able to access it at a particular time.
-> When you don't make your method synchronized then your method or your object counter 
	is not thread safe.
